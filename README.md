# 🖥️ Design and Programming-Oriented Principles

This repository contains various projects and examples demonstrating different **Design** and **Programming paradigms**, focusing on practical implementations and theoretical principles. The repository covers topics in object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming, design patterns, and software architecture.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The repository includes examples that demonstrate:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.
- **Functional Programming (FP)**: Pure functions, immutability, and first-class functions.
- **Design Patterns**: Common software design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, and Observer.
- **Software Architecture**: Principles for designing scalable and maintainable systems.

Each project in the repository includes a hands-on example of how these principles are applied in code.

## 💻 Projects

Here are the main areas of focus in this repository:

```
├── Project1 - Object-Oriented Design Example
├── Project2 - Functional Programming with Python
